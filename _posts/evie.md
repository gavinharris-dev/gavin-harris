Gavin helped develop the Node JS Middleware, Salesforce Integration and Angular web application.

## Salesforce

* Creation of sObjects (custom objects)
* Development of Flows
* Creation of APEX Classes to handle tasks
* Development of Lightening Components

## Node JS Middleware

Leading in the development of the security layer for the API's. Utilizing the brilliant [Auth0](https://www.auth0.com) to create a secure means of authentication
where users are able to utilise Social Authentication providers (Facebook, Google and for a time Domain (a custom Auth provider)) and also allowing for email / password authentication provider.
Development of a translation middleware to take the data from Salesforce and convert it into a form ready for Loop's Web and Device applications.
These API's need to be highly performant.
